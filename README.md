# AlphaPilot

This reprository holds all of the code I have used to create a vision model for the Alpha Pilot Challenge.
Data_loader is the code I used to load the Alpha Pilot Data and transform it into a useable numpy array
TheModel is the code for my initial testing and tinkering with scailing models on the data, most were naive approaches but inspired my better work in the next file
Playground is the code for the training and saving of my current best models using a Training class I defined myself to make the process easier
Lastly, TheCrazyPlace, named quaintly because this file served as a sanity check that everything I had done so far worked, in this file the code can be used to load a trained model and predict images from the dataset and plot the results on the images to visually see how well the model is performing.
